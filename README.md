This is to be a blank repository to store Sitecore 7.5 (preview release) dependencies as a NuGet package. Hopefully, to get all Sitecore dependencies you will just need to reference this package.


### Exclusions
- ITHit.WebDAV.Server.dll
-- Couldn't find on NuGet and no one uses WebDAV anyway.
- RadEditor.Net2
-- Not on NuGet might be propietary
- Stimulsoft.Base, Stimulsoft.Database, Stimulsoft.Report, Stimulsoft.Report.Web, Stimulsoft.Report.WebDesign
-- Same as above
- Sitecore.* assemblies
-- Same as above
